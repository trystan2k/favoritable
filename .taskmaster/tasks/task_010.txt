# Task ID: 10
# Title: Define & Implement Bookmark Data Model
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the database schema and ORM definitions for the Bookmark entity.
# Details:
Define `Bookmark` table with `id`, `url`, `slug`, `title`, `description`, `author`, `thumbnail`, `state`, `publishedAt`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `userId` fields. Implement Drizzle schema and migrations.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for ORM operations (create, read bookmark).

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Drizzle Schema for Bookmark Table [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the Drizzle ORM schema definition for the `Bookmark` table, including all specified fields and a foreign key relationship to the `User` table.
### Details:
Define the table using Drizzle's `pgTable` function. Include fields: `id`, `url`, `slug`, `title`, `description`, `author`, `thumbnail`, `state`, `publishedAt`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`. Add the `userId` field with a foreign key constraint referencing the `users` table's `id`.

## 2. Generate SQL Migration for Bookmark Schema [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Use the Drizzle Kit command-line tool to generate a new SQL migration file based on the schema definition created in the previous subtask.
### Details:
Run the `drizzle-kit generate:pg` command. Review the generated SQL file to ensure it accurately creates the `bookmarks` table with all the correct columns, data types, and foreign key constraints.

## 3. Apply Migration and Write Unit Test [done]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Apply the generated migration to the test database and write a unit test to confirm the Bookmark data model works as expected by creating and reading a bookmark record.
### Details:
Execute the migration script to update the database schema. Create a new test file for the bookmark model. Write a test case that uses the Drizzle ORM to insert a new bookmark and then retrieves it, asserting that the returned data is correct.
