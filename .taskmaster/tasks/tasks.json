First, configure an HTTP client (e.g., Axios or a fetch wrapper) to include credentials in requests to handle the session cookies set by the backend. Implement a global authentication state management solution, such as a React Context (`AuthContext`), to provide user data and authentication status throughout the application. The login flow will involve redirecting the user to the appropriate backend OAuth endpoint (e.g., `/login/google`) from the UI. Upon successful authentication and redirection back to the frontend, the app should query a dedicated backend endpoint (e.g., `/api/session`) to fetch the current user's session data and populate the auth context. Implement a logout function that calls a `/logout` endpoint on the backend to destroy the session and then clears the local auth state. To ensure session persistence, the application should check the `/api/session` endpoint on initial load. Finally, create a protected route mechanism using TanStack Router that checks the auth context and redirects unauthenticated users to the login page.",

This task involves a full refactor to align with the library's conventions.\n\n1. **Installation**: Add the Better Auth React client to the frontend project: `pnpm add better-auth/react`.\n2. **Client Initialization**: At the root of the React application (e.g., `main.tsx`), import `createAuthClient` and initialize it. Wrap the main application component with the provider component from the library to make the auth client available throughout the component tree.\n3. **Replace AuthContext**: Remove the custom `AuthContext` and its provider. Search the codebase for all instances of `useContext(AuthContext)` and replace them with the `useSession` hook from `better-auth/react`. This hook provides reactive session data, including user information, authentication status (`authenticated`, `unauthenticated`), and loading states.\n4. **Refactor Login Flow**: Update the login UI components. Instead of using `window.location` to redirect to backend OAuth endpoints, use the client instance. For example, a Google login button's `onClick` handler should call `authClient.signIn.social({ provider: 'google' })`.\n5. **Refactor Logout Flow**: Replace the manual HTTP call to the backend's logout endpoint with a single call to `authClient.signOut()`.\n6. **Update Protected Routes**: Modify the protected route logic. Instead of checking a value from the old custom context, use the status provided by the `useSession` hook (e.g., `const { session } = useSession(); if (session.status !== 'authenticated') { ... }`). The library's hooks will handle redirects and loading states more gracefully.\n7. **Update Tests**: All unit and integration tests related to authentication must be updated.

Verify the application redirects to the login page. After logging in, navigate to the same protected URL and confirm the page loads correctly.\n4. **Logout Verification**: Click the logout button. Verify that the `useSession` hook updates to reflect an unauthenticated state and the user is redirected to a public page (e.g., the login page).\n5. **Regression Testing**: Run the entire frontend test suite (`pnpm test`) to ensure that all updated tests pass and that the refactoring has not introduced any regressions in other parts of the application.",
