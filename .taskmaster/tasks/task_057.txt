# Task ID: 57
# Title: Investigate Performance Improvements
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19, 18
# Priority: low
# Description: Research and identify areas for performance optimization in both frontend and backend, with a primary focus on implementing an effective caching strategy.
# Details:
Analyze database queries, API response times, and frontend rendering performance. The main implementation will be a caching layer. Evaluate different caching solutions: distributed caching with Redis for scalability vs. simpler in-memory caching using libraries like `node-cache` or `memory-cache`. The cache should be designed to handle bookmark data, URL metadata, and the results of frequently accessed queries. Also investigate other improvements like database indexing and lazy loading.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct load testing and performance profiling before and after changes. Measure improvements in key metrics like API response times and page load speed. Verify cache effectiveness by checking hit/miss rates and ensuring data consistency.
