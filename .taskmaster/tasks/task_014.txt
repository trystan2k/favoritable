# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Persistent User Sessions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure user sessions are persistent using Better Auth's built-in session management.
# Details:
Configure Better Auth to manage persistent sessions using its database adapter and HTTP-only cookies. Better Auth's built-in functionality will handle session validation on backend routes.

# Test Strategy:
Log in, close the browser, and reopen to verify the user is still logged in via the persistent session cookie. Test session expiration by waiting for the defined session lifetime and ensuring the user is logged out.
