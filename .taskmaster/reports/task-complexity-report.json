Evaluate Railway and Fly.io based on pricing, Docker support, and ease of CI/CD integration, and document the final decision. 2. Create a multi-stage Dockerfile for the Hono API to optimize for small image size and security. 3. Configure the chosen platform's deployment file (e.g., `fly.toml`) and set up GitHub Actions for automated deployment on pushes to the main branch. 4. Perform an initial deployment and write a health check endpoint to verify the service is live and accessible.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity. This task combines multiple distinct disciplines: technology research/selection, containerization (Dockerfile), platform-specific infrastructure-as-code (fly.toml), and CI/CD pipeline automation. Each step has its own learning curve and potential for issues."

If the user doesn't exist, implement a `createUserFromOAuth` function that maps provider data to the `User` schema and saves it. 4. If the user already exists, retrieve their record. 5. In both cases (new or existing user), create a new session for the user and redirect them to the frontend.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity. This logic is at a critical point in the user journey. It requires careful, atomic database operations (query, then potentially create) and robust error handling to ensure a seamless experience for both new and returning users."

Modify the `POST /bookmarks` and `POST /labels` endpoints to extract the authenticated `userId` from the request context and include it in the new record. 2. Update all `GET`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` endpoints for bookmarks and labels to include a `WHERE userId = ?` clause to ensure users can only access their own data. 3. Update API tests to pass an authenticated user context and verify that the `userId` is correctly set and enforced.",
			"reasoning": "Low complexity. This is a standard authorization pattern. The auth middleware makes the user ID available; this task is about applying that ID in database queries. It's a repetitive but straightforward change across several endpoints."

Implement comprehensive error handling for common scraping issues like timeouts, 404s, and pages without standard metadata.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity. Web scraping is inherently fragile and unreliable. The task requires not just calling a library, but building a robust service around it that can handle timeouts, various content types, and anti-scraping measures. This often requires an asynchronous approach for good UX."

Rename `config-biome` to `lint-config` and update its `package.json` name. 3. Update `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to reflect the new directory structure. 4. Perform a global search-and-replace to update all references to the old package names/paths. 5. Run `pnpm install` and all root-level scripts (`lint`, `test`) to verify the toolchain is intact.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-low complexity. The task doesn't involve writing new logic but requires careful, repository-wide changes to configuration files and dependencies. The risk is in missing a reference, so the complexity lies in the diligence and verification required, not in the problem-solving."
