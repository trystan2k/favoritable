		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Repositories",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task 'Setup Project Repositories' into subtasks for initializing the pnpm monorepo workspace, creating the frontend and backend package stubs, configuring a shared TypeScript `tsconfig.base.json`, and setting up root-level scripts for managing the workspace.",
			"reasoning": "This is a foundational configuration task. While not logically complex, getting the monorepo structure, shared configurations (like TypeScript), and workspace tooling (pnpm) right is crucial and involves several distinct steps. The complexity is low-to-medium as it's primarily configuration, but critical for the project's health."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Frontend Project",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Initialize Frontend Project' into subtasks for scaffolding the TanStack Start project, installing core dependencies, configuring SSR and file-based routing, integrating and configuring Shadcn UI, and setting up Vitest with React Testing Library.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves integrating multiple modern tools (TanStack Start, Shadcn, Vitest). Each has its own setup and configuration process. Ensuring they work together seamlessly, especially with SSR, adds moderate complexity beyond a simple 'create-react-app'."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Backend Project",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the task 'Initialize Backend Project' into subtasks for initializing the Node.js/TypeScript project, installing Hono and Vitest, creating a basic 'hello world' server endpoint, and configuring the initial Vitest test setup.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is low as Hono is a minimal framework and the initial setup is straightforward. The task is well-defined and follows standard Node.js/TypeScript project initialization patterns. Breaking it down ensures a clean and testable starting point."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend: Implement Add New Bookmark UI",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task 'Implement Add New Bookmark UI' into subtasks for creating the form component using Shadcn UI, implementing form state management and validation (e.g., with React Hook Form), developing the API submission logic with TanStack Query to handle loading and error states, and integrating the form into the main UI, possibly as a dialog/modal.",
			"reasoning": "This is a standard but multi-faceted UI task. It requires combining UI components, client-side state management, validation, and asynchronous API communication. Properly handling loading, error, and success states adds to the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 22,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend: Display Auto-fetched Metadata",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Display Auto-fetched Metadata' into subtasks for updating the bookmark card component to display the fetched metadata (title, description, thumbnail), modifying the 'Add Bookmark' UI to show a preview and pre-fill form fields after URL analysis, and ensuring the 'Edit Bookmark' form also displays this metadata.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity lies in integrating new data points into multiple existing components (card, add form, edit form). It requires careful handling of the data flow and conditional rendering, but the core logic is not overly complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 24,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend: Implement Favorite/Unfavorite UI",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task 'Implement Favorite/Unfavorite UI' into subtasks for adding a favorite toggle button (e.g., a star icon) to the bookmark card component, creating a TanStack Query mutation to call the favorite/unfavorite API endpoint, implementing an optimistic update for instant UI feedback, and ensuring the main bookmark list query is invalidated upon success.",
			"reasoning": "While the feature seems simple, a high-quality implementation involves more than just an API call. Implementing optimistic updates for a smooth UX and correct cache invalidation with TanStack Query adds a layer of moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 26,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend: Implement Archive/Unarchive UI",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the task 'Implement Archive/Unarchive UI' into subtasks for adding an archive button to the bookmark card, creating a TanStack Query mutation for the archive API endpoint, implementing the UI logic to remove the archived item from the active view, and ensuring relevant queries (e.g., 'All' and 'Archived' collections) are invalidated to reflect the change.",
			"reasoning": "This is functionally similar to the 'Favorite' task. The complexity comes from managing the client-side state correctly, especially removing the item from one list and ensuring it's available in another, which requires robust cache invalidation logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 32,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend: Implement Default Collections UI",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Default Collections UI' into subtasks for creating the navigation component in the sidebar for 'All', 'Favorites', and 'Archived', implementing state management to track the currently selected collection (preferably using URL parameters), modifying the main bookmark fetching logic to apply the correct filters based on the selected collection, and adding visual indicators for the active collection.",
			"reasoning": "This task is central to the app's navigation and data display. It requires architecting a clean filtering system that coordinates UI, global state (or URL state), and data fetching. The complexity score reflects the need to manage this application-wide state effectively."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 34,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend: Implement Search Bookmarks UI",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task 'Implement Search Bookmarks UI' into subtasks for creating the search input component, managing the search query state, implementing debouncing for the input to optimize API calls, integrating the search query into the bookmark data fetching hook, and designing a UI state for 'no results found'.",
			"reasoning": "A performant and user-friendly search requires more than a simple input field. Implementing debouncing to prevent excessive API requests is a key requirement that adds complexity. Coordinating the UI, state, debouncing logic, and API integration justifies the moderate complexity score."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 36,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend: Implement Sort Bookmarks UI",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the task 'Implement Sort Bookmarks UI' into subtasks for creating a dropdown/select component for sorting options (e.g., 'Date Added', 'Title'), managing the state of the current sort selection (ideally via URL params), updating the data fetching logic to include the selected sort parameters in the API request, and ensuring the selected sort option is reflected in the UI.",
			"reasoning": "This is a standard feature that enhances usability. The complexity is moderate, as it involves coordinating UI components, state management, and data-fetching logic. It's a well-understood pattern but requires careful implementation to work seamlessly with other filters and pagination."
