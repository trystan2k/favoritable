			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of integrating Lucia Auth into the following subtasks: 1. Install Lucia and Hono adapter dependencies. 2. Define and migrate database schemas for `User` and `Session` tables. 3. Initialize and configure the Lucia Auth instance in the Hono application. 4. Create and apply a middleware to validate sessions and attach user context to requests. 5. Implement basic protected and unprotected route examples to test the integration.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to it being a foundational security component. It requires careful setup of the library, database schema changes for users and sessions, and integration into the Hono middleware stack. Breaking it down ensures each part (schema, config, middleware) is handled correctly."

Integrate Google OAuth provider. 3. Integrate GitHub OAuth provider. 4. Integrate Facebook OAuth provider. 5. Integrate Twitter OAuth provider. 6. Integrate Apple OAuth provider.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity due to the number of external integrations (5 providers). Each provider requires separate developer account setup, application configuration, and handling of unique callback data structures. Apple and Twitter can be particularly complex. A subtask per provider is a logical breakdown."

			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of implementing persistent sessions into two subtasks: 1. Configure session duration and cookie attributes in the Lucia Auth setup. 2. Write an automated test to verify a user remains logged in after a browser restart.",
			"reasoning": "Low complexity because Lucia Auth's database adapter handles most of the persistence logic out-of-the-box. The work is primarily configuration (e.g., session duration) and verification, not building a system from scratch."

In the OAuth callback, implement logic to query the database for an existing user based on the provider's user ID. 2. If the user does not exist, implement the logic to create a new user record using profile data from the provider. 3. If the user exists, or after creation, proceed with creating and setting the user's session.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. The logic inside the OAuth callback is critical for the user lifecycle. It requires careful database interaction: checking for an existing user based on provider ID, creating a new user record with data from the provider, and then creating a session for them."

Add a `userId` foreign key to the `labels` table and update all label-related endpoints to be user-scoped. 3. Write integration tests to verify that users can only access their own bookmarks and labels.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity due to its cross-cutting nature. It requires modifying multiple database schemas (bookmarks, labels) and updating all related CRUD endpoints to enforce user ownership. This requires careful auditing to ensure no data access loopholes are left."

Integrate a metadata scraping library (e.g., `metascraper`) to fetch data from the provided URL. 3. Implement comprehensive error handling for network failures, timeouts, and parsing errors.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. While libraries simplify HTML parsing, this task involves I/O with unpredictable external websites. It requires robust error handling for timeouts, non-HTML content, and malformed metadata. Performance is also a concern, making it more complex than a simple database endpoint."

Update the `LabelsSidebar` to set the active filter when a label is clicked. 3. Modify the `BookmarkList` data fetching logic to include the active filter in its API request.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-low complexity. This requires coordinating state between two separate components (sidebar and bookmark list). This can be managed via URL routing or a global state manager, adding a layer of complexity over a self-contained component."

Implement a reusable file upload component that handles file selection and validation. 3. Implement the logic to upload the selected file to the correct backend endpoint and display progress, success, or error messages to the user.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. Handling file uploads on the frontend involves more than a standard form. It requires using the File API, constructing `FormData` objects, and providing user feedback on the status of a potentially long-running operation."

Implement data formatting (e.g., to JSON) and set the appropriate `Content-Disposition` and `Content-Type` headers to trigger a file download.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-low complexity. The core logic involves fetching all of a user's data and formatting it. The complexity comes from ensuring it's performant and doesn't consume excessive memory if a user has thousands of bookmarks."

Implement state management to track the list of selected bookmark IDs. 3. Add a 'Delete Selected' button that becomes active when items are selected and triggers the batch delete API call after a confirmation.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. This introduces a new 'selection' mode or state to the main bookmark list. It requires managing an array of selected IDs, updating the UI to reflect selections, and handling the batch action, which is more involved than single-item actions."

Ensure the bookmark list/grid view adapts correctly to different screen widths. 3. Verify that all modals and forms are usable on small screens. 4. Test and fix navigation and header elements on mobile.",

			"complexityScore": 10,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the SSE background job system into: 1. Implement the SQLite-based job queue for persisting jobs. 2. Create the isolated Puppeteer worker in a child process. 3. Develop the job coordinator to manage the queue and dispatch jobs to workers. 4. Implement the Hono SSE endpoint to stream job status updates. 5. Implement the frontend client to consume the SSE stream and display real-time progress. 6. Write integration tests for the end-to-end job processing flow.",
			"reasoning": "Highest complexity. This task introduces a new asynchronous architecture with multiple moving parts: a persistent job queue, child process management for isolation, inter-process communication, and a real-time streaming API. It's a significant engineering effort with many potential failure points."

			"taskTitle": "Define & Implement Frontend Folder Structure",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the folder structure task into: 1. Propose and document a new folder structure (e.g., feature-based or atomic design). 2. Refactor existing components, hooks, and pages into the newly defined structure.",
			"reasoning": "Low complexity. This is an organizational task that involves discussion and agreement on conventions, followed by moving files. It's not technically challenging but is important for maintainability."

			"taskTitle": "Review General Frontend Best Practices",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the best practices review into: 1. Review and refactor components for better composition and reusability. 2. Audit the state management strategy for consistency and efficiency. 3. Implement error boundaries around key parts of the application.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-low complexity. This is a review and refactoring task. It requires knowledge of best practices but the implementation is typically applying established patterns rather than inventing new solutions."

			"taskTitle": "Backend: AI Suggest Labels Endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the AI label suggestion task into: 1. Research and select an appropriate NLP/AI service (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere). 2. Create the backend endpoint to receive a bookmark's content. 3. Implement the logic to call the AI service API with a well-formed prompt. 4. Implement logic to parse the AI response and format it as a list of suggested labels.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. Integrating with an external AI service involves API key management, prompt engineering to get useful results, and handling potentially slow or variable responses. It's more than a simple data lookup."

			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "The task is already well-defined with 6 subtasks. Use the existing subtasks to structure the work: 1. Create render.yaml. 2. Configure environment variables. 3. Create Render service and enable auto-deploy. 4. Validate database connectivity. 5. Verify web scraping functionality. 6. Document the deployment process.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity. This is a critical DevOps task that bridges development and production. It requires correctly defining the infrastructure as code, managing production secrets securely, configuring a CI/CD pipeline, and debugging potential issues in a cloud environment (e.g., networking, permissions, dependencies like Puppeteer)."

			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the `userId` handling audit into: 1. Review all API route handlers and middleware to ensure `userId` is correctly extracted from the session. 2. Audit all service and repository functions to confirm `userId` is passed down and used in queries. 3. Write a suite of integration tests specifically designed to attempt cross-tenant data access and assert failure. 4. Review all API response DTOs to ensure `userId` is never exposed to the client.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity. This is a critical security audit. Missing a single check could lead to a major data breach. It requires a meticulous, defense-in-depth review of every data-accessing part of the application and writing specific tests to prove that data isolation is enforced."
