		{
			"taskId": 63,
			"taskTitle": "Fix Logger Error Handler Order Issue",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task 'Fix Logger Error Handler Order Issue' into subtasks for implementation, unit testing, and manual verification.",
			"reasoning": "This is a well-defined, low-risk bug fix localized to a single function. The logic change is simple, and the path to verification is clear, making the complexity low."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 44,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend: Implement Batch Delete Bookmarks UI",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Batch Delete Bookmarks UI' into subtasks covering UI component creation for selection, the main action button, state management for selected items, and the API integration for deletion.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves moderate complexity as it requires coordinated changes across multiple frontend layers: UI components, client-side state management, and API communication."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 47,
			"taskTitle": "Ensure Responsive Layout",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the task 'Ensure Responsive Layout' into subtasks for auditing and implementing responsiveness for key areas of the application, such as the main navigation, dashboard, item list view, and settings pages.",
			"reasoning": "This is a high-complexity task due to its broad scope, affecting the entire application. It requires extensive refactoring and testing across numerous components and screen sizes."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 48,
			"taskTitle": "Ensure WCAG AA Accessibility",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task 'Ensure WCAG AA Accessibility' into subtasks focused on key accessibility pillars: conduct an initial audit, ensure full keyboard navigability, add ARIA attributes and semantic HTML, verify color contrast, and perform manual screen reader testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task has very high complexity. It requires specialized knowledge of WCAG standards, impacts the entire codebase, and necessitates meticulous manual and automated testing to ensure compliance."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Persistent User Sessions",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the task 'Implement Persistent User Sessions' into subtasks for configuring the Lucia Auth database adapter, setting up the session cookie middleware, creating a test route to verify authentication, and writing end-to-end tests for session persistence and expiration.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is low-to-medium as the task primarily involves configuring a third-party library's built-in features rather than implementing complex logic from scratch."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Select & Setup Database",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task 'Select & Setup Database' into subtasks for creating the Turso database instance, installing and configuring Drizzle ORM, implementing the database connection client, and creating a test script to verify the connection.",
			"reasoning": "This is a foundational setup task with low-to-medium complexity. While critical, the steps are well-documented, and the effort is concentrated on configuration and integration, not complex coding."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 52,
			"taskTitle": "Generate API Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Generate API Documentation' into subtasks: first, integrate the OpenAPI/Swagger library and configure the UI. Then, create subtasks for documenting each major API resource, such as Users, Bookmarks, and Authentication.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity. While the initial tool setup is straightforward, the task's scope is large, requiring meticulous annotation of every API endpoint, which can be time-consuming and detail-oriented."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 54,
			"taskTitle": "Conduct Production Readiness Review",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the 'Conduct Production Readiness Review' task into a checklist of subtasks covering key areas: Security audit (dependencies, secrets), Performance testing, Logging and Monitoring setup, Backup and Disaster Recovery plan, and final configuration review.",
			"reasoning": "This is a high-complexity process task. Its difficulty lies in the immense breadth and criticality of the review, which covers multiple domains like security, infrastructure, and performance, requiring a holistic system understanding."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 60,
			"taskTitle": "Review General Frontend Best Practices",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Review General Frontend Best Practices' task into subtasks for auditing specific areas: review component structure and props, analyze the state management implementation, assess bundle size and code splitting opportunities, and check for consistent error handling patterns.",
			"reasoning": "This is a complex architectural review task. It requires senior-level expertise to audit the entire frontend codebase against best practices for maintainability, performance, and scalability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Linting & Formatting",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the task 'Configure Linting & Formatting' into subtasks: install dependencies, create a root biome.json configuration, configure Knip, add package.json scripts for linting/formatting/checking, and create a CI workflow step to run these checks.",
			"reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity due to the intricacies of setting up tooling in a monorepo. Ensuring configurations are correctly inherited and scripts target all workspaces properly can be challenging."
