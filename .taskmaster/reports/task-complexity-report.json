			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the 'Investigate & Address URL Scrapping Issues' task into an investigation phase to identify failure patterns, a research phase for advanced tools like Puppeteer, an implementation phase to build a more robust scraping service, a refactoring of the import process to use it, and a validation phase against known problematic URLs.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity. This task moves into the difficult domain of advanced web scraping. It requires dealing with complex, hostile environments (e.g., anti-bot measures) and may necessitate significant architectural changes like introducing a headless browser, which has performance and infrastructure implications."

			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Investigate Performance Improvements' task into subtasks for profiling and identifying bottlenecks, designing a caching strategy (in-memory vs. Redis), implementing the cache layer, implementing cache invalidation logic, applying database optimizations like indexing, and load testing to verify improvements.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity. Performance optimization is a complex field. Implementing caching correctly is non-trivial, as it introduces challenges with data consistency and cache invalidation. This task requires profiling, architectural design, implementation, and verification."

			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the 'Investigate Server-Sent Events (SSE)' task into its core architectural components: a subtask for the SQLite job queue, one for the child process worker, one for the job coordinator, one for the Hono SSE endpoint, one for the inter-process communication mechanism, and one for the frontend client to consume the stream.",
			"reasoning": "Maximum complexity. This task introduces several highly complex concepts simultaneously: asynchronous background processing, a persistent job queue, inter-process communication, and real-time client updates. Architecting these components to work together reliably is a significant engineering challenge."

			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Review General Frontend Best Practices' task into specific areas of focus: a subtask for state management strategy, one for component design patterns, one for error handling with error boundaries, one for performance via code splitting, and a code review session to share findings.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. This is a code quality and architecture review task. It requires a good understanding of best practices, and the implementation involves small, incremental changes across the codebase."
