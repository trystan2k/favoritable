**Title**: Fix Logger Error Handler Order Issue

### Summary
- Status: Completed
- Estimated time: 1.5 hours
- Time spent: 1.5 hours
- Approach used: Refactored error handler logic to process specific error handlers before fallback to UnexpectedError

### Implementation
- Modified files: 
  - apps/api/src/errors/errors.handlers.ts (main fix)
  - apps/api/tests/errors.handlers.test.ts (comprehensive unit tests)
- Tests added: yes - 11 comprehensive unit tests covering all error handler scenarios
- Dependencies: Task #3 (completed)

### Technical Changes
1. **Root Cause**: Error handler immediately converted non-APIError instances to UnexpectedError before allowing specific error handlers to process them
2. **Fix**: Reordered logic to:
   - First check if error is already APIError (pass through)
   - For non-APIErrors, attempt processing with specific handlers first
   - Only use UnexpectedError as final fallback if no specific handler matches
3. **Test Coverage**: Added tests for specific error types (SyntaxError, LibsqlError variants), handler ordering, and fallback scenarios

### Key Insights
- The error handler order issue was subtle - serviceErrorsHandler was converting unhandled errors to UnexpectedError, preventing repositoryErrorsHandler from processing database-specific errors
- Tests revealed the importance of handler ordering in the main app configuration
- Unit tests demonstrate the fix works correctly and provide regression protection

### Observations
- Error handling improved: specific error types now logged with correct types instead of generic UnexpectedError
- Test coverage for error handling significantly improved (98.61% coverage for errors.handlers.ts)
- Found that error mapper design could be improved to pass through unhandled errors instead of immediately converting to UnexpectedError
- QA checks all pass clean

### Future Improvements
- Consider updating error mappers to be more permissive (return original error if unhandled rather than converting to UnexpectedError)
- Add integration tests that trigger actual API errors to verify end-to-end behavior
