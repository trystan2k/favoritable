### Complete Task Overview

**Objective**: Update authentication strategy from Auth.js to Better Auth, setting up Better Auth with the Hono backend for session-based authentication using HTTP-only cookies.

#### Subtask 12.1: Install Better Auth and Adapter Dependencies
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Implementation**: Added Better Auth v1.3.7 and Hono adapter to project dependencies
- **Outcome**: All lint issues resolved, QA checks passing

#### Subtask 12.2: Define and Migrate User and Session Database Schemas  
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Implementation**: Updated database schema with User and Session tables for Better Auth
- **Outcome**: Database migrations applied successfully

#### Subtask 12.3: Initialize and Configure Better Auth in Hono
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Implementation**: Created auth configuration with database adapter and session settings
- **Outcome**: Better Auth instance properly initialized with HTTP-only cookies

#### Subtask 12.4: Implement Hono Middleware for Session Validation
- **Status**: ✅ Completed  
- **Implementation**: Developed middleware to validate sessions and attach user context
- **Outcome**: Session validation working across all routes

#### Subtask 12.5: Implement and Test Protected and Unprotected Routes
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Implementation**: Created test routes to verify authentication middleware functionality
- **Outcome**: Both protected and public routes working correctly

#### Subtask 12.6: Implement Better Auth Error Handling
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Implementation**: Added comprehensive error handling following existing patterns
- **Outcome**: Auth errors properly mapped and handled with appropriate HTTP status codes

#### Subtask 12.7: Move Auth Routes to Dedicated File
- **Status**: ✅ Completed  
- **Implementation**: Refactored auth routes into dedicated AuthRoutes class with DI integration
- **Files Created**: `apps/api/src/features/common/auth/auth.routes.ts`
- **Files Modified**: `apps/api/src/index.ts`
- **Outcome**: Code properly organized following established patterns
- **Commit**: 7391e8e - feat(auth): move auth routes to dedicated class

### Technical Architecture Implemented

**Authentication Flow**:
1. Better Auth initialized with database adapter
2. HTTP-only session cookies for security
3. Middleware validates sessions on each request
4. User and session data attached to request context
5. Protected routes check authentication status

**Key Components**:
- **Database Schema**: User and Session tables with proper relationships
- **Auth Configuration**: Better Auth instance with cookie settings
- **Middleware**: Session validation and user context attachment
- **Routes Organization**: Dedicated AuthRoutes class with dependency injection
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive auth error mappers and handlers

**API Endpoints**:
- `/api/test/no-auth` - Public test endpoint
- `/api/test/with-auth` - Protected test endpoint requiring authentication
- `/api/auth/session` - Session information endpoint
- `/api/auth/*` - Better Auth handler routes (login, logout, etc.)

### Observations
- **Migration Success**: Successfully migrated from Auth.js to Better Auth with minimal disruption
- **Security Implementation**: HTTP-only cookies provide secure session management
- **Code Organization**: Follows established patterns with proper dependency injection
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling maintains consistency with existing codebase
- **Testing**: All QA checks passing, authentication flow verified
- **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with middleware-based approach

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Better Auth v1.3.7**: Chosen for its stability and Hono compatibility
- **Session-based Auth**: HTTP-only cookies for enhanced security
- **Middleware Pattern**: Non-intrusive session validation across all routes
- **DI Integration**: AuthRoutes properly registered in dependency injection container
- **Error Handling**: Auth-specific error mappers following existing patterns
- **Directory Structure**: `features/common/auth` for shared authentication components

### Possible Future Improvements
- **OAuth Integration**: Task #13 ready to add Google, Facebook, GitHub, Apple, Twitter providers
- **Rate Limiting**: Consider auth-specific rate limiting for login attempts  
- **Session Management**: Advanced session features like remember me, device tracking
- **Security Headers**: Additional security headers for auth endpoints
- **Audit Logging**: Track authentication events for security monitoring

### Quality Assurance Final Status
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: All files type-check correctly
- ✅ Biome linting: Code style and formatting consistent
- ✅ Knip analysis: No unused dependencies detected
- ✅ Test coverage: All existing tests passing, new auth tests added
- ✅ Build process: Production build successful
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks: All quality gates passing

### Next Dependencies Unblocked
- **Task #13**: Configure OAuth Providers (depends on Task #12)
- Authentication infrastructure now ready for OAuth provider integration
