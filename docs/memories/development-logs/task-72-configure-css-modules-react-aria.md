## Task Development #72
**Date**: 2025-09-19_20:30:42
**Title**: Configure and Apply CSS Modules for React Aria Components

### Summary
- Status: Completed
- Estimated time: 2-3 hours
- Time spent: ~2 hours
- Approach used: Incremental conversion of all components and pages to CSS Modules
- Subtasks completed: 72.1, 72.2, 72.3, 72.4, 72.5

### Implementation
- Modified files:
  - apps/frontend/src/components/ThemeSwitcher.tsx (converted to CSS Modules)
  - apps/frontend/src/components/ThemeSwitcher.module.css (created)
  - apps/frontend/src/routes/__root.tsx (converted to CSS Modules)
  - apps/frontend/src/routes/index.tsx (converted to CSS Modules)
  - apps/frontend/src/routes/about.tsx (converted to CSS Modules)
  - apps/frontend/src/routes/Layout.module.css (created)
  - apps/frontend/src/global.d.ts (created for TypeScript support)
  - apps/frontend/src/styles/global.css (cleaned up duplicate styles)
  - docs/DEV_WORKFLOW.md (added comprehensive CSS Modules conventions)
  - All test files updated to work with CSS Modules

- Tests added: Updated existing tests to use CSS Modules class assertions
- Dependencies: No new dependencies added
- Commits made: Task completed but commits not yet made (need to create feature branch and commits)

### Observations
- CSS Modules configuration was already working from previous session (subtasks 72.1 and 72.2)
- Successfully converted all existing components and layouts to use CSS Modules
- Maintained 100% test coverage throughout the refactoring
- All styles now properly use design tokens from Style Dictionary
- Removed duplicate button styles from global.css, reducing bundle size
- Added comprehensive TypeScript support for CSS Modules
- Documented complete CSS Modules conventions in DEV_WORKFLOW.md
- All quality checks pass with `pnpm run complete-check`

### Technical Decisions Made
- Used shared Layout.module.css for route-level styles to avoid duplication
- Created TypeScript declarations for CSS Modules in global.d.ts
- Maintained existing button styling patterns while converting to modules
- Updated tests to import styles objects instead of string matching

### Possible Future Improvements
- Consider creating more granular CSS Module files as more components are added
- Could add CSS Modules linting rules to enforce conventions
- May want to create shared mixins for common styling patterns
