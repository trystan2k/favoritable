## Task Development #6
**Date**: 2025-08-16_03:26:33
**Title**: Implement Docker Image creation for future deployment

### Summary
- Status: Completed
- Estimated time: 2-3 hours
- Time spent: ~2.5 hours
- Approach used: Multi-stage Docker containerization with Puppeteer support

### Implementation
- Modified files:
  - `apps/api/Dockerfile` (new - multi-stage production container)
  - `apps/api/.dockerignore` (new - build optimization)
  - `apps/api/README.md` (updated - added comprehensive Docker deployment section)
  - `apps/api/package.json` (updated - added Docker scripts and fixed build command)
  - `apps/api/tsconfig.build.json` (new - separate build configuration)
  - `apps/api/tsconfig.json` (updated - cleaned up configuration)
  - `apps/api/src/core/puppeteer.scrapper.ts` (enhanced - better string cleaning)
  - `apps/api/src/utils/string.ts` (enhanced - added removeTrailingLeadingSpaces method)
  - `apps/api/src/core/dependency-injection/di.decorators.ts` (fixed - ESM imports)
  - `package.json` (updated - improved prepare script for Docker)
  - `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json` (updated - task status tracking)

- Tests added: No new tests required - existing tests validate API functionality
- Dependencies: Added system dependencies for Puppeteer in Docker container

### Observations
- Successfully created production-ready Docker container with multi-stage build
- All Puppeteer system dependencies properly installed for headless Chromium
- Container security implemented with non-root user execution
- Comprehensive documentation added for local development and production deployment
- Docker convenience scripts added for easy container management
- Enhanced string cleaning utilities for better web scraping results
- All QA checks passed successfully before commit
- User made additional improvements to Dockerfile structure and scraper functionality

### Technical Decisions Made
- Used Node.js 24-slim base image for optimal size and compatibility
- Implemented multi-stage build to separate build-time from runtime dependencies
- Configured Puppeteer to use system Chromium instead of bundled version
- Added health check endpoint for container monitoring
- Created separate TypeScript build configuration for production optimizations

### Possible Future Improvements
- Consider implementing container registry push automation
- Add Docker Compose configuration for local development with database
- Implement container resource limits and monitoring
- Consider adding multi-architecture builds for ARM64 support
