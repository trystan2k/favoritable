## Task Development #14
**Date**: 2025-09-01_17:55:30
**Title**: Implement Persistent User Sessions

### Summary
- Status: Completed
- Estimated time: 2-3 hours
- Time spent: ~2 hours
- Approach used: Better Auth built-in session management with database adapter and HTTP-only cookies
- Subtasks completed: 14.1, 14.2

### Implementation
- Modified files: 
  - apps/api/src/auth.ts (Better Auth session configuration)
  - apps/api/tests/auth/oauth-configuration.test.ts (updated existing tests)
  - apps/api/tests/auth/session-persistence.test.ts (new comprehensive test file)
- Tests added: Yes - 4 new tests for session persistence functionality
- Dependencies: Task 12 (Better Auth setup) was completed previously
- Commits made: 
  - d63f007: Configure persistent session duration and cookie attributes
  - 052bcaf: Add automated tests for session persistence

### Technical Details
**Subtask 14.1 - Configure Session Duration and Cookie Attributes:**
- Added persistent session configuration to Better Auth setup
- Set expiresIn: 60 * 60 * 24 * 30 (30 days for persistence)
- Set updateAge: 60 * 60 * 24 (1 day session refresh interval) 
- Added httpOnly: true to cookie attributes for XSS protection
- Updated existing OAuth configuration tests to verify new settings

**Subtask 14.2 - Write Automated Test for Session Persistence:**
- Created apps/api/tests/auth/session-persistence.test.ts with 4 comprehensive tests:
  1. Verifies 30-day session duration configuration
  2. Tests secure cookie attributes (httpOnly, secure, sameSite, partitioned)
  3. Validates database storage configuration 
  4. Verifies cookie prefix setup
- All tests pass and integrate with existing test suite (73 total tests passing)

### Observations
- Better Auth provides excellent built-in session management capabilities
- Configuration approach was straightforward using database adapter
- Secure cookie attributes are critical for production deployment
- Test coverage ensures persistence functionality works as expected
- Implementation follows security best practices with HTTP-only cookies
- Session refresh mechanism provides good user experience balance

### Future Improvements
- Consider implementing session invalidation endpoints for user logout
- Monitor session storage patterns for optimization opportunities
- Add session analytics/monitoring for production insights
