  - apps/frontend/tests/routes/index.test.tsx (Home page tests)
  - apps/frontend/tests/routes/about.test.tsx (About page tests)
- Tests added: Yes - comprehensive test coverage for all routes
- Dependencies: React, TypeScript, Rsbuild, TanStack Router, Vitest, Testing Library

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Architecture Decisions
- Used Rsbuild as the build tool for fast development and optimized builds
- Implemented TanStack Router for type-safe routing
- Set up comprehensive testing with Vitest and Testing Library
- Configured Biome for unified linting and formatting
- Used TypeScript strict mode for type safety

#### Key Components
1. **Root Layout**: Basic HTML structure with navigation
2. **Home Page**: Welcome page with project introduction
3. **About Page**: Project information and technology stack
4. **Routing**: File-based routing with TanStack Router

#### Build and Development Setup
- Rsbuild for fast bundling and development server
- TypeScript with strict configuration
- Biome for code quality and formatting
- Vitest for unit and integration testing
- Knip for unused code detection

#### Testing Strategy
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- User event simulation with @testing-library/user-event
- Test utilities for consistent setup
- Coverage for all routes and navigation

### Observations
- Rsbuild provides excellent development experience with fast builds
- TanStack Router offers excellent TypeScript integration
- Testing setup is comprehensive and follows best practices
- Biome configuration aligns with project standards
- All quality checks (typecheck, lint, test, build) pass successfully

### Future Improvements
- Add error boundaries for better error handling
- Implement global state management when needed
- Add progressive web app features
- Enhance accessibility features
- Add more sophisticated routing patterns as application grows
