## Task Development #12.6
**Date**: 2025-08-30_20:52:47
**Title**: Implement Better Auth Error Handling

### Summary
- Status: Completed
- Estimated time: 2 hours
- Time spent: 2 hours
- Approach used: Created dedicated auth error mapper with Better Auth APIError integration
- Subtask completed: 12.6

### Implementation
- Created files: src/errors/auth-errors.mappers.ts, tests/errors/auth-errors.mappers.test.ts
- Modified files: src/errors/errors.mappers.ts (renamed to repository-errors.mappers.ts), src/index.ts
- Tests added: Yes - comprehensive unit tests with 11 test cases, 100% pass rate
- Dependencies: better-auth package for APIError types
- Commits made: Single focused commit for subtask 12.6 with proper error handling implementation

### Observations
- Better Auth provides specific APIError types with status codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 422, 429)
- Mapped each status code to appropriate custom error types (BadRequestError, UnauthorizedError, etc.)
- Integrated auth error handler into main error processing chain in index.ts
- Maintained consistent error handling patterns with existing repository/service error mappers
- All QA checks passed (typecheck, lint, knip, test coverage, build)
- Successfully refactored error mappers for better organization (split repository vs service vs auth errors)

### Technical Decisions Made
- Created separate auth-errors.mappers.ts for Better Auth specific error handling
- Used type guards to safely check Better Auth APIError instances
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing error handling patterns
- Added comprehensive test coverage for all status code mappings

### Future Improvements
- Consider adding more specific error messages based on Better Auth error context
- Monitor for additional Better Auth error types that may need mapping
