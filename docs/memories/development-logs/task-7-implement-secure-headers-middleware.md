## Task Development #7
**Date**: 2025-08-05_09:26:35
**Title**: Implement Secure Headers Middleware

### Summary
- Status: Completed
- Approach used: Replaced the existing manual security headers with the `hono/secure-headers` middleware for a more robust and maintainable solution.

### Implementation
- Modified files:
  - `apps/api/src/core/http.headers.ts`
- Tests added: No new tests were added as part of this task. Verification was done by inspecting the HTTP response headers.

### Observations
- The previous implementation was missing key security headers like CSP.
- The `hono/secure-headers` middleware provides a comprehensive and easy-to-configure solution.
- The `update_task` tool in Task Master had issues with subtask dependency validation, which required a workaround.
