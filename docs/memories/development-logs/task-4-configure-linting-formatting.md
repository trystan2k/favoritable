## Task Development #4
**Date**: 2025-08-09_19:38:34
**Title**: Configure Linting & Formatting

### Summary
- Status: Completed
- Estimated time: 2 hours
- Time spent: 1.5 hours
- Approach used: Set up Biome V2 as unified linting and formatting tool with root configuration

### Implementation
- Modified files: 
  - biome.json (root configuration)
  - packages/config-biome/biome.json (shared config, later simplified)
  - packages/config-biome/package.json
  - knip.json (dependency analysis)
  - package.json (added scripts and dependencies)
- Tests added: Verified through format/lint commands and complete-check script
- Dependencies: Added @biomejs/biome ~2.1.4 and knip ~5.62.0

### Observations
- Biome V2 requires single root configuration rather than extends mechanism for monorepos
- Parameter decorators needed to be enabled for existing dependency injection code
- Knip has compatibility issue with zod-validation-error dependency but configuration is ready
- Successfully formatted 106 files and established consistent code style
- Pre-existing lint issues are now visible and can be addressed incrementally
