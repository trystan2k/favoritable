## Task Development #62
**Date**: 2025-08-12_16:47:15
**Title**: Configure Husky for Git Hooks

### Summary
- Status: Completed
- Estimated time: 30 minutes
- Time spent: 45 minutes
- Approach used: Husky with lint-staged integration

### Implementation
- **Created .husky directory structure**:
  - `.husky/pre-commit` - TypeScript/React lint-staged hook
  - `.husky/pre-push` - Full test suite validation
- **Added lint-staged configuration in package.json**:
  - TypeScript files: Biome linting and formatting + type checking
  - All files: Biome formatting
- **Updated dependencies**:
  - Added `husky` as devDependency
  - Added `lint-staged` as devDependency
- **Configured scripts**:
  - `prepare` script for Husky installation
  - `typecheck` script for pre-commit validation
- **Resolved configuration issues**:
  - Fixed TypeScript path resolution in workspace
  - Added proper workspace package.json scripts
  - Corrected lint-staged glob patterns
  - Ensured proper Biome configuration inheritance

### Task Details
Implemented all 4 subtasks:
1. **62.1**: Install Husky Dependency ✅ (was already completed)
2. **62.2**: Initialize Husky Configuration ✅ (fixed pre-commit hook to use lint-staged)
3. **62.3**: Create Pre-commit Hook for Quality Checks ✅ (implemented lint-staged with proper checks)
4. **62.4**: Create Pre-push Hook for Testing ✅ (created pre-push hook with test coverage)

### Final Configuration
- **Pre-commit hook**: `npx lint-staged` with proper TypeScript/React configuration
- **Pre-push hook**: `pnpm test:coverage`
- **Strategy**: Uses lint-staged for selective file processing with workspace integration
- **Safety**: Only safe fixes applied automatically (no --unsafe flag)

### Observations
- Husky `add` command is deprecated, created hooks manually
- ADR-013 strategy successfully implemented with lint-staged enhancement
- Both hooks properly executable and configured
- QA passes completely (typecheck, lint, format, knip, test coverage, build)
- Proper workspace integration with TypeScript path resolution
- lint-staged properly configured for monorepo structure

### Quality Verification
- All QA checks passed: typecheck ✓, check:fix ✓, knip ✓, test:coverage ✓, build ✓
- No lint/format issues
- All tests passing with coverage
- Build successful
- Husky hooks execute properly

### Technical Decisions Made
- Used manual hook creation instead of deprecated `husky add` command
- Followed ADR-013 specification with lint-staged enhancement
- Ensured hooks are executable with proper shebang
- Implemented workspace-aware TypeScript checking
- Used lint-staged for performance optimization

### Possible Future Improvements
- Could add pre-push validation for branch naming conventions
- Could add commit message linting if needed
- Could add pre-commit validation for specific file patterns
