## Task Development #62
**Date**: 2025-08-12_16:47:15
**Title**: Configure Husky for Git Hooks

### Summary
- Status: Completed
- Estimated time: 30 minutes
- Time spent: 25 minutes
- Approach used: Husky with Biome native --staged flag

### Implementation
- Modified files: 
  - `.husky/pre-commit` (updated from default npm test to proper commands)
  - `.husky/pre-push` (created new file)
- Tests added: No new tests - verified existing hooks work with configuration
- Dependencies: husky package (already installed in subtask 62.1)

### Task Details
Implemented all 4 subtasks:
1. **62.1**: Install Husky Dependency ✅ (was already completed)
2. **62.2**: Initialize Husky Configuration ✅ (fixed pre-commit hook to use pnpm commands)
3. **62.3**: Create Pre-commit Hook for Quality Checks ✅ (implemented proper hook)
4. **62.4**: Create Pre-push Hook for Testing ✅ (created pre-push hook with test coverage)

### Final Configuration
- **Pre-commit hook**: `pnpm typecheck && pnpm biome check --write --staged`
- **Pre-push hook**: `pnpm test:coverage`
- **Strategy**: Uses Biome's native `--staged` flag (no lint-staged needed)
- **Safety**: Only safe fixes applied automatically (no --unsafe flag)

### Observations
- Husky `add` command is deprecated, created hooks manually
- ADR-013 strategy successfully implemented
- Both hooks properly executable and configured
- QA passes completely (typecheck, lint, format, knip, test coverage, build)
- Aligned with project's pnpm usage (not npm)

### Quality Verification
- All QA checks passed: typecheck ✓, check:fix ✓, knip ✓, test:coverage ✓, build ✓
- No lint/format issues
- All tests passing with coverage
- Build successful

### Technical Decisions Made
- Used manual hook creation instead of deprecated `husky add` command
- Followed ADR-013 specification exactly
- Ensured hooks are executable with proper shebang

### Possible Future Improvements
- Could add pre-push validation for branch naming conventions
- Could add commit message linting if needed
- Could add pre-commit validation for specific file patterns
