## Task Development #71
**Date**: 2025-09-13_20:32:23
**Title**: Migrate Frontend Component Library from Radix UI to React Aria Components

### Summary
- Status: Completed
- Estimated time: 3-4 hours
- Time spent: ~4 hours
- Approach used: Systematic component-by-component migration
- Subtasks completed: 71.1, 71.2, 71.3, 71.4, 71.5

### Implementation
- Modified files: 
  - apps/frontend/package.json (dependency updates)
  - apps/frontend/src/components/Button.tsx (full refactor)
  - packages/themes/src/components/button.css (styling updates)
  - apps/frontend/src/routes/index.tsx (component usage updates)
  - apps/frontend/README.md (documentation updates)
  - docs/ADRs/003-A-frontend-component-library-migration.md (new ADR)
- Tests added: Manual testing performed, no unit tests added as none existed previously
- Dependencies: Removed @radix-ui/* packages, added react-aria-components, react-aria, react-stately
- Commits made: 5 individual commits for each subtask

### Observations
- Migration was straightforward due to minimal existing components
- React Aria Components provide better accessibility out of the box
- Data attribute naming differences required CSS updates (data-state vs data-pressed/focused)
- Established clear patterns for future component development
- Project now has solid foundation for accessible component development
