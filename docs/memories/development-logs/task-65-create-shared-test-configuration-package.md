**Date**: 2025-08-12_23:34:27
**Title**: Create Shared Test Configuration Package (`test-config`)

### Summary
- Status: Completed
- Estimated time: 45 minutes
- Time spent: 45 minutes
- Approach used: Created monorepo shared package with base Vitest configuration

### Implementation
- Modified files: 
  - packages/test-config/package.json (created) - Updated naming convention to @favoritable/test-config and added full package configuration
  - packages/test-config/vitest.config.ts (created) - Simplified base config without React plugin, focusing on core coverage settings
  - packages/test-config/biome.json (created) - Added linting/formatting configuration
  - packages/test-config/knip.json (created) - Added knip configuration for unused dependency detection
  - apps/frontend/package.json (updated) - Added workspace dependency and updated TypeScript version
  - apps/frontend/vitest.config.ts (updated) - Uses mergeConfig to extend base config with frontend-specific settings
  - apps/frontend/knip.json (updated) - Streamlined ignored dependencies
  - apps/api/package.json (updated) - Added workspace dependency, moved dependencies correctly, updated TypeScript version
  - apps/api/vitest.config.ts (updated) - Uses mergeConfig to extend base config with API-specific settings
  - apps/api/knip.json (updated) - Streamlined configuration
  - apps/api/tests/ - Moved test directory from test/ to tests/ for consistency
  - packages/config-biome/package.json (updated) - Moved @biomejs/biome to devDependencies
  - packages/typescript-config/ - Added biome.json and updated package.json
  - Root package.json (updated) - Added knip dependency
- Tests added: Yes - verified both frontend and API tests pass using shared configuration
- Dependencies: Streamlined vitest and coverage dependencies across packages

### Observations
- Successfully created centralized test configuration package at packages/test-config with @favoritable/test-config naming
- Simplified base Vitest config without React plugin to make it more universally applicable across backend and frontend
- Comprehensive coverage configuration with consistent defaults and app-specific overrides
- Both frontend and API apps successfully extend base configuration using mergeConfig
- Consistent workspace dependency management across all packages
- Streamlined knip configurations removing unnecessary ignored dependencies
- Moved API tests from test/ to tests/ directory for consistency across the monorepo
- Updated all packages to use consistent TypeScript version (5.7.3)
- Added proper biome and knip configurations to all packages for consistent tooling
- All tests pass and coverage works correctly with shared configuration across both apps
