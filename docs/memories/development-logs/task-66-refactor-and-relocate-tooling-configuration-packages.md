## Task Development #66
**Date**: 2025-08-13_01:09:34
**Title**: Refactor and Relocate Tooling Configuration Packages

### Summary
- Status: Completed
- Estimated time: 45 minutes
- Time spent: ~60 minutes
- Approach used: Systematic 5-step approach with sequential subtask completion

### Implementation
- Modified files: 
  - Created packages/development/ directory structure
  - Moved packages/config-biome → packages/development/lint-config
  - Moved packages/test-config → packages/development/test-config
  - Moved packages/typescript-config → packages/development/typescript-config
  - Updated pnpm-workspace.yaml with packages/development/*
  - Updated 11 files with @favoritable/config-biome → @favoritable/lint-config references
  - Updated pnpm-lock.yaml through pnpm install
- Tests added: No new tests - verified existing tests pass
- Dependencies: Tasks 4, 62, 65 (all completed)

### Observations
- Tool-agnostic naming (`lint-config` vs `config-biome`) improves future flexibility
- Organized package structure in packages/development/ provides better separation of all development tooling
- All development configuration packages now unified under packages/development/ (lint-config, test-config, typescript-config)
- All 5 subtasks completed successfully with proper dependency tracking
- Lockfile required regeneration after workspace changes - handled in subtask 66.5
- Pre-commit hooks initially failed until pnpm install resolved new package references
- Final toolchain verification confirmed all systems working correctly
- Turbo build cache correctly invalidated and rebuilt with new package structure
