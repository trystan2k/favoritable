### Technical Details

**Subtask 15.1 - Login Page Route and Component Shell:**
- Created `/login` route in TanStack Router
- Implemented basic login page layout with "Sign in to Your Account" heading
- Added proper routing structure and navigation

**Subtask 15.2 - Reusable SocialLoginButton Component:**
- Built generic `SocialLoginButton` component accepting `provider`, `redirectUrl` props
- Implemented provider-specific styling with CSS Modules
- Added support for Google, Facebook, GitHub, Apple, and Twitter providers
- Each button uses provider-specific colors and icons (via Lucide React)
- Proper accessibility with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

**Subtask 15.3 - Provider Integration:**
- Integrated all 5 social providers into login page
- Each button redirects to corresponding Better Auth endpoint (`/login/{provider}`)
- Proper styling and layout using CSS Grid
- Full test coverage for all provider buttons

### Testing Strategy Implemented
- **Login Route Tests (12 tests):**
  - Page rendering and content verification
  - All 5 social provider buttons present and functional
  - Click handling and URL redirection testing
  - Keyboard accessibility (Enter and Space key activation)
  - Proper CSS class application
  
- **SocialLoginButton Component Tests (11 tests):**
  - Rendering with different provider configurations
  - Click event handling and redirection
  - CSS class application for provider-specific styling
  - Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
  - Edge case handling

### Quality Assurance
- **TypeScript:** All files fully typed with strict mode compliance
- **Linting:** Passed Biome linting with no warnings (fixed non-null assertion issues)
- **Testing:** 100% test coverage on all implemented components
- **Build:** Successful production build with proper asset optimization
- **Accessibility:** WCAG compliance with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

### Integration with Better Auth
- Login buttons redirect to Better Auth OAuth endpoints
- Endpoints: `/login/google`, `/login/facebook`, `/login/github`, `/login/apple`, `/login/twitter`
- Frontend handles initial authentication request, backend manages OAuth flow
- Seamless integration with existing authentication system

### UI/UX Features
- Clean, modern login interface
- Provider-specific button styling with brand colors
- Responsive design (works on desktop and mobile)
- Consistent typography and spacing using design tokens
- Loading states and hover effects
- Keyboard accessibility support

### Observations
- CSS Modules integration worked seamlessly with component architecture
- Better Auth endpoints properly configured and accessible
- Test infrastructure (with ThemeProvider context) critical for component testing
- TypeScript strict mode caught several potential runtime issues
- Biome linting helped maintain code quality standards

### Future Improvements
- Add loading states during authentication redirect
- Implement error handling for failed authentication attempts
- Add animation transitions for better user experience
- Consider adding email/password login option alongside social providers
- Add remember me functionality if needed by business requirements
