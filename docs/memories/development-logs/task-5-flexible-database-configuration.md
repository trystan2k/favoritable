## Task Development #5
**Date**: 2025-08-15_19:27:22
**Title**: Implement Flexible Database Configuration

### Summary
- Status: Completed
- Estimated time: 1 hour
- Time spent: 45 minutes
- Approach used: Environment-based database type switching with separate URL variables

### Implementation
- Modified files: 
  - `apps/api/src/env.ts` - Added DATABASE_TYPE enum and separate URL schema
  - `apps/api/src/db/index.ts` - Updated client configuration logic
  - `apps/api/drizzle.config.ts` - Updated to use new environment variables
  - `apps/api/.env` - Simplified with clear variable separation
  - Removed `apps/api/.env.local` and `apps/api/.env.dev` (no longer needed)
  - User moved db health script to `apps/api/src/db/utils/` (better organization)
- Tests added: No new tests - existing functionality maintained
- Dependencies: No new dependencies

### Technical Implementation Details
- Replaced single `DATABASE_URL` with `DATABASE_TYPE` enum ('local' | 'turso')
- Added separate `LOCAL_DATABASE_URL` and `TURSO_DATABASE_URL` environment variables
- Updated database client to automatically select appropriate URL based on `DATABASE_TYPE`
- Simplified environment configuration to single `.env` file
- Eliminated URL parsing logic in favor of explicit type-based switching

### Usage
- For local SQLite development: `DATABASE_TYPE=local`
- For Turso development/testing: `DATABASE_TYPE=turso`

### Observations
- Much cleaner configuration compared to URL parsing approach
- Single variable change enables easy database switching
- Explicit separation of concerns between local and remote database URLs
- Simplified maintenance with single environment file
- All TypeScript checks passing successfully
- Configuration is now more maintainable and less error-prone

### Future Improvements
- Could add validation to ensure required URLs are present based on DATABASE_TYPE
- Could add environment-specific script shortcuts for common database operations
