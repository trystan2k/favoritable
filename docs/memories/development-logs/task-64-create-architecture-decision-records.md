## Task Development #64
**Date**: 2025-08-11_12:23:53
**Title**: Create Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for Key Technologies

### Summary
- Status: Completed
- Estimated time: 1-2 hours
- Time spent: ~1 hour
- Approach used: Followed subtask structure, created simplified ADR format focused on 4 required sections

### Implementation
- Modified files: Created 6 new ADR files in existing docs/ADRs directory
  - docs/ADRs/007-backend-stack.md (Hono, SQLite, Drizzle)
  - docs/ADRs/008-project-structure.md (Monorepo, Turborepo)
  - docs/ADRs/009-testing-frameworks.md (Vitest, React Testing Library)
  - docs/ADRs/010-typing-and-validation.md (TypeScript, Zod)
  - docs/ADRs/011-developer-tooling.md (Bruno, Puppeteer)
  - docs/ADRs/012-logging.md (Pino)
- Tests added: No tests required - documentation task
- Dependencies: None

### Observations
- Created simplified ADR format with exactly the 4 required sections: Context, Decision, Status, Consequences
- All ADRs set to "Accepted" status as required
- Moved files to existing docs/ADRs directory and renumbered as 007-012 to continue existing sequence
- Each ADR provides comprehensive rationale for technology choices with clear positive/negative consequences
- Documentation will help with onboarding and future technology decision tracking
