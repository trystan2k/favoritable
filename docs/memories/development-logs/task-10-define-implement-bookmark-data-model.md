## Task Development #10
**Date**: 2025-08-17_19:22:17
**Title**: Define & Implement Bookmark Data Model

### Summary
- Status: Completed
- Estimated time: 2-3 hours
- Time spent: ~3 hours
- Approach used: Database-first design with Drizzle ORM

### Implementation
- Modified files: 
  - `apps/api/src/db/schema/bookmark.schema.ts` (added userId field, removed URL unique constraint)
  - `apps/api/src/db/migrations/0000_past_toro.sql` (fresh migration with proper schema)
  - `apps/api/src/features/bookmarks/bookmark.mappers.ts` (updated to accept userId)
  - `apps/api/tests/db/schema/bookmark-model.test.ts` (comprehensive test suite with 7 test cases)
- Tests added: Yes - 7 comprehensive test cases covering CRUD, relationships, constraints, and cascade delete
- Dependencies: Completed subtasks 10.1, 10.2, 10.3

### Key Changes Made
1. **Schema Updates**: Added `userId` field with foreign key reference to users table
2. **URL Uniqueness**: Removed global unique constraint to allow multiple users to bookmark same URLs
3. **Relationships**: Implemented proper user-bookmark relationship mapping
4. **Migration**: Created clean migration without unique URL constraint
5. **Testing**: Full test coverage including duplicate URL validation, cascade deletes, and foreign key constraints

### Technical Decisions
- **URL Uniqueness Removal**: Chose to remove global unique constraint on URLs for multi-user functionality
- **Cascade Delete**: Implemented ON DELETE CASCADE for user-bookmark relationship
- **Migration Strategy**: Used Drizzle Kit with TypeScript compilation to ensure accurate schema generation

### Observations
- **Drizzle Kit Issue**: Required building TypeScript before generating migrations (drizzle.config.ts reads from ./dist/)
- **Schema Consistency**: Followed existing patterns from label schema for user relationships
- **Test Coverage**: All 32 tests passing with comprehensive bookmark model validation

### Future Improvements
- Consider adding composite indexes for frequently queried user+URL combinations
- Potential for per-user URL uniqueness constraints if needed in the future
- bookmark.mappers.ts still uses placeholder 'temp-user-id' - will be updated when authentication is implemented
