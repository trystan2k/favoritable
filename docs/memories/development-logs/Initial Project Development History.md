## Task Development #favoritable-initial-development
**Date**: 2025-08-01
**Title**: Initial Development and Scaffolding of the 'favoritable' Project

### Summary
- Status: Completed
- Estimated time: N/A
- Time spent: N/A
- Approach used: A multi-stage process that involved setting up the initial project structure, implementing the core API functionalities, and establishing a comprehensive development workflow with documentation and quality checks.

### Implementation
- **Modified files**: A comprehensive list of files across the entire project, including:
  - Core project configuration (`.gitignore`, `package.json`, `turbo.json`, etc.)
  - API implementation (`apps/api/src/**/*.ts`)
  - Database schema and migrations (`apps/api/src/db/**/*.ts`)
  - API testing files (`apps/api/bruno/**/*.bru`)
  - Documentation (`docs/**/*.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`)
  - Tooling and workflow scripts (`.trae/rules/**/*.md`, `.taskmaster/**/*.json`)
- **Tests added**: No (Initial setup did not include automated tests)
- **Dependencies**: N/A

### Observations
- The project was initialized with a modern monorepo structure using pnpm and Turbo.
- A significant effort was made to establish a robust development workflow from the outset, including detailed documentation, quality checks, and agent integration guides.
- The core API was built with a clear separation of concerns, including features for bookmarks and labels, and a well-defined error handling and logging mechanism.
- The use of Bruno for API testing and a structured approach to database schema management with Drizzle were key technical decisions.
- The project's history shows a strong emphasis on documentation and developer experience from the very beginning.
