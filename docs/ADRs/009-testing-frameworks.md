# ADR-009: Testing Frameworks (Vitest and React Testing Library)

**Date**: 2025-08-11  
**Status**: Accepted  

## Context

The favoritable project requires a comprehensive testing strategy covering both backend API logic and frontend React components. We need testing frameworks that provide:
- Fast test execution for rapid development feedback
- Excellent TypeScript integration matching our tech stack
- Modern testing capabilities including mocking, assertions, and coverage
- React component testing with user-centric approach
- Integration with our Vite-based build tooling
- Support for both unit and integration testing patterns

## Decision

We have chosen **Vitest** as our primary test runner and **React Testing Library** for frontend component testing.

**Vitest** provides a fast, Vite-native test runner with excellent TypeScript support, built-in mocking capabilities, and compatibility with Jest APIs for easy migration and familiar developer experience.

**React Testing Library** offers a user-centric testing philosophy that focuses on testing components as users interact with them, promoting better testing practices and more maintainable tests.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

**Positive Consequences:**
- Extremely fast test execution due to Vitest's Vite integration and parallel testing
- Seamless TypeScript support without additional configuration
- Better testing practices encouraged by React Testing Library's user-focused approach
- Excellent developer experience with built-in watch mode and hot reloading
- Strong ecosystem compatibility with existing Jest-based testing patterns
- Native ES modules support improving test reliability and performance
- Built-in code coverage reporting without additional setup

**Negative Consequences:**
- Smaller community compared to Jest, potentially fewer third-party resources
- React Testing Library requires learning curve for developers used to Enzyme patterns
- Some legacy Jest plugins may not be directly compatible with Vitest
- Additional complexity in testing setup for developers unfamiliar with modern testing approaches
