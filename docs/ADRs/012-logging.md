# ADR-012: Logging (Pino)

**Date**: 2025-08-11  
**Status**: Accepted  

## Context

The favoritable project requires a robust logging solution for the backend API to support:
- Structured logging for better observability and debugging
- High-performance logging that doesn't impact API response times
- Integration with our Hono-based backend architecture
- Support for different log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- JSON output format for easier parsing by log aggregation tools
- Proper error tracking and request/response logging
- Development-friendly output formatting for local debugging

## Decision

We have chosen **Pino** as our logging library for the backend API.

**Pino** provides extremely fast, structured logging with JSON output by default. It offers excellent performance characteristics, minimal overhead, and integrates seamlessly with Node.js applications. The library supports child loggers, custom serializers, and various transport options for different environments.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

**Positive Consequences:**
- Excellent performance with minimal impact on API response times
- Structured JSON logging enables better log analysis and monitoring
- Rich ecosystem of transports and plugins for different deployment scenarios
- Built-in request/response logging capabilities perfect for API debugging
- Child logger support allows contextual logging across request lifecycle
- TypeScript support with excellent developer experience
- Easy integration with log aggregation services (ELK stack, Datadog, etc.)

**Negative Consequences:**
- JSON output format can be harder to read during local development without pretty-printing
- Requires additional configuration for optimal development vs production environments
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with structured logging concepts
- Additional dependency and setup complexity compared to simple console.log debugging
