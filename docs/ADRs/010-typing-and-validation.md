# ADR-010: Type Safety and Validation (TypeScript and Zod)

**Date**: 2025-08-11  
**Status**: Accepted  

## Context

The favoritable project requires robust type safety and data validation across both frontend and backend to ensure:
- Compile-time type checking to prevent runtime errors
- Runtime data validation for API inputs and external data sources
- Consistent data structures across the full stack
- Developer productivity through excellent IDE support and autocomplete
- Safe handling of user inputs and external data (URLs, HTML content)
- Schema-driven development with single source of truth for data structures

## Decision

We have chosen **TypeScript** for static type safety and **Zod** for runtime data validation and schema declaration.

**TypeScript** provides compile-time type checking, excellent tooling support, and ensures type safety across our entire codebase including React components, API handlers, and database operations.

**Zod** serves as our schema validation library, offering TypeScript-first schema declaration, runtime validation, and the ability to infer TypeScript types from schemas, creating a single source of truth for our data structures.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

**Positive Consequences:**
- Comprehensive type safety from database to UI components
- Single source of truth for data schemas through Zod schema definitions
- Excellent developer experience with autocomplete and compile-time error detection
- Runtime safety for API inputs and external data validation
- Reduced bugs through static analysis and runtime validation
- Seamless integration with our existing tech stack (Hono, Drizzle, React)
- Self-documenting API contracts through schema definitions

**Negative Consequences:**
- Additional development overhead for writing and maintaining type definitions
- Learning curve for developers new to TypeScript or schema validation concepts
- Potential performance overhead from runtime validation (though minimal with Zod)
- More verbose code compared to plain JavaScript, especially for complex types
- Build time overhead for TypeScript compilation across the monorepo
