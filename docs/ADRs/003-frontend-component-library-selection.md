# ADR-003: Frontend Component Library Selection

**Date**: 2025-01-11  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Development Team  

## Context

The favoritable frontend application requires a component library that meets the following requirements:
- **React Compatibility**: Must work seamlessly with React and TypeScript
- **CSS Flexibility**: Support for both CSS modules and data-attribute styling patterns
- **Performance**: High performance with minimal bundle impact
- **Accessibility**: WAI-ARIA compliant and accessibility-first approach
- **Maintainability**: Well-supported with active development
- **Component Completeness**: Ready-to-use components with built-in accessibility
- **Developer Experience**: Strong TypeScript support and good documentation
- **Design Token Integration**: Seamless integration with existing design system

The project tech stack includes:
- React with TypeScript
- Rsbuild as the build tool
- CSS modules and data-attribute styling for components
- Modern development practices focused on performance and accessibility
- @favoritable/themes design token system

We need to select a component library that provides complete components rather than just primitives, with excellent accessibility and modern styling approaches.

## Decision

### Component Library: React Aria Components

**Choice**: [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/components.html) as the primary component library

**Rationale**:
- **Complete Components**: Provides ready-to-use components with built-in accessibility, not just primitives
- **Data-Attribute Styling**: Uses modern `data-*` attributes for state-based styling (hover, pressed, focused, disabled)
- **Performance Excellence**: Tree-shakable with zero runtime CSS, only JavaScript for behavior
- **Accessibility Leadership**: Built by Adobe's React Spectrum team, industry leader in accessibility
- **TypeScript Native**: Excellent TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- **Active Development**: Continuous development with regular updates and strong community
- **Styling Freedom**: Works with any CSS approach - CSS modules, utility classes, or styled-components
- **Modern React Patterns**: Uses modern React APIs and patterns (React 18+)
- **Design System Integration**: Perfect integration with @favoritable/themes

```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Setup ✅
1. ~~Install React Aria Components package~~
2. ~~Configure TypeScript types for React Aria components~~
3. ~~Establish data-attribute styling conventions~~
4. ~~Create core Button component~~

### Phase 2: Enhanced Styling ✅
1. ~~Create CSS classes for data-attribute styling~~
2. ~~Implement button variants (solid, soft, outline, ghost)~~
3. ~~Add hover, pressed, focused, disabled states~~
4. ~~Integrate with existing design tokens~~

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation ✅
1. ~~Verify all existing tests pass~~
2. ~~Test component functionality in development server~~
3. ~~Validate build output and bundle size~~
4. ~~Update documentation~~

## Considered Alternatives

### Component Library Alternatives

| Option | Pros | Cons | Decision |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| **React Aria Components** | Complete components, data-attr styling, accessibility leader | Learning curve for data attributes | ✅ **Selected** |
| **Radix UI** | Unstyled primitives, good accessibility | Requires extensive wrapper development | ❌ Development overhead |
| **Base UI** | MUI team backing, React Aria foundation | Smaller ecosystem, newer | ❌ Less mature |
| **Headless UI** | Tailwind ecosystem, polished | Limited components, Tailwind-focused | ❌ Ecosystem mismatch |
| **Mantine** | Full-featured, styled | CSS-in-JS conflicts with modules | ❌ Styling conflicts |
| **Ant Design** | Comprehensive, mature | Heavy bundle, hard to customize | ❌ Customization issues |

## Benefits

1. **Development Velocity**: Significantly faster component development with ready-to-use components
2. **Accessibility Excellence**: Best-in-class accessibility with minimal effort
3. **Styling Power**: Data-attribute styling provides more powerful state management
4. **Bundle Optimization**: Tree-shakable components with zero runtime CSS overhead
5. **Modern Patterns**: Uses latest React patterns and APIs
6. **Future-Proof**: Maintained by Adobe with long-term support commitment
7. **Design System Integration**: Perfect integration with @favoritable/themes
8. **Developer Experience**: Excellent TypeScript support and comprehensive documentation

## Implementation Results

### Current Implementation
- **Bundle Size**: 321.1 kB total (excellent tree-shaking)
- **Components**: Full-featured Button with complete state management
- **Development Time**: Minimal setup required for new components
- **Accessibility**: Excellent (React Aria Components)

### Code Example

```tsx
import { Button } from 'react-aria-components';

<Button className="button-solid">
  Click me
</Button>
```

## Considerations for Future

### When to Consider Other Libraries
- **Mantine/Ant Design**: If we need a complete design system with pre-built themes
- **Headless UI**: If we migrate to Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Custom Components**: If we need highly specialized components not available in React Aria

### Extension Strategy for Complex Components
1. **Start with React Aria Components**: Use as the foundation for all new components
2. **Gradual Enhancement**: Add custom styling and behavior as needed
3. **Accessibility First**: Leverage React Aria's accessibility expertise
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor bundle size impact of each new component
