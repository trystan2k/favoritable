# Development Workflow Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ### FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES

THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE MANDATORY and must be strictly followed throughout development. No item can be neglected. NEVER ASSUME ANYTHING - ALWAYS ASK IF IN DOUBT.

- **Attention**: NEVER, NEVER start to implement a task without been requested to do so.
- Also always start the task from the `main` branch and ensure it is up-to-date with remote.
- **Important**: Remember that this project use `pnpm`.

## üîÑ STANDARD WORKFLOW

### 1. üìã TASK RECEPTION

- **Action**: Await clear instructions on which task to implement
- Receive the task or subtask to be developed
- Identify the task ID in the Task Master system
- **Action**: Check if task is already implemented, if so, ask for clarification
- Ensure that your are at `main` branch, otherwise, checkout it.
- **Action**: Run `git pull` to ensure that your branch is up-to-date with remote.
- **Action**: Create a feature branch based on `main` and do your work on this feature branch
- Create one feature branch per task ID and commit all subtasks in this same branch (do not create branch for subtasks)
- Feature branch should follow the pattern `feature/FAV-[ID]-[title]`
- **Action**: Check if task is already expanded, otherwise expand it

### 2. üîç OBTAINING DETAILS

- **Action**: Use **MCP Task Master** to get full details (never the CLI tool)
- Extract essential information:
  - Title and description
  - Dependencies
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Test strategy
  - Specific technical details

### 3. üß† PLANNING WITH DEEPTHINK

- **Action**: Use `deepthink` to create a detailed action plan
- **Planning principles**:
  - ‚úÖ **Simplicity**: Always seek the simplest solution
  - ‚ùå **Avoid overengineering**: Do not overcomplicate unnecessarily
  - üéØ **Elegance**: Clean and well-structured solutions
  - üìù **Documentation**: Clear and executable plan

**Deepthink plan template**:

```markdown
## Task Analysis
- Main objective:
- Identified dependencies:
- System impact:

## Chosen Approach
- Proposed solution:
- Justification for simplicity:
- Components to be modified/created:

## Implementation Steps
1. [Specific step]
2. [Specific step]
3. [Specific step]

## Validation
- Success criteria:
- Checkpoints:
```

### 4. üìä STATUS UPDATE - START

- **Action**: Mark the task/subtask as `in-progress` in Task Master
- Confirm that the status has been successfully updated

### 5. üîç INITIAL QUALITY VERIFICATION

- **Action**: Run `pnpm run complete-check` before starting development
- **If problems are reported**:
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **STOP** - do not proceed with development
  - Resolve ALL identified problems
  - Run `pnpm run complete-check` again until clean
  - Only then proceed to implementation

### 6. ‚öôÔ∏è IMPLEMENTATION

- Follow the plan created in deepthink

#### üîÑ Subtask Development Cycle

For tasks with subtasks, follow this cycle for each subtask:

1. **Implement subtask** following the deepthink plan
2. **Quality check** - Run `pnpm run complete-check` before commit
3. **Review request** - Ask for code review before committing
4. **Commit subtask** - Create one commit per completed subtask
5. **Push request** - Ask for permission to push after commit
6. **Repeat** for next subtask

- **Each subtask = One commit** for better traceability
- Keep commits focused and atomic per subtask
- **Principles during implementation**:
  - üéØ Focus on the essential
  - üìù Comment code when necessary
  - üß™ Write tests according to the defined strategy
  - üîÑ Perform incremental refactorings

### 7. üîç SUBTASK QUALITY VERIFICATION

- **Action**: Run `pnpm run complete-check` before each subtask commit
- **If problems are reported**:
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **MANDATORY** - resolve ALL problems
  - Do not proceed to commit until QA is clean
  - Run again until it passes completely
  - If you are still struggling to fix it (cannot fix in 5 interactions, for example), ask for help

### 8. üìù SUBTASK COMMIT CYCLE

For each subtask completion:

- **Action**: Before commit, ask me to review the changes and only continue after my ok
- **Action**: Ask me if I did any code change during review. If so, review the changes and use this info for the commit
- **Action**: Run `pnpm run complete-check` one final time before commit
- **Action**: Commit with descriptive message following the pattern below
- **Action**: Ask permission to push the subtask commit

**Subtask commit message pattern**:

```bash
type(scope): brief description of actual work done

- Specific changes made in this subtask
- Files modified/created
- Tests added (if any)
```

### 9. üîç FINAL QUALITY VERIFICATION

- **Action**: After ALL subtasks are complete, run `pnpm run complete-check` one final time
- **Action**: Ensure entire task implementation works as expected
- **If problems are reported**:
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **MANDATORY** - resolve ALL problems
  - This is the final quality gate before task completion

### 10. ‚úÖ TASK STATUS UPDATE - COMPLETION

- **Action**: Update the task with complete implementation details covering all subtasks
- **Action**: Mark the task as `done` in Task Master
- Confirm that the status has been updated correctly
- Confirm that all subtasks are marked as complete

### 11. üìù DEVELOPMENT LOGGING

- **Action**: Use **Basic Memory MCP** to log development for all subtasks (if it exist, otherwise for the task implemented).
- **Action**: Once the task is complete, read all info related to it (task and subtasks notes) in **Basic Memory MCP** and create physical file with the information about the implementation of the task.
- **Log template** (should cover the entire task and all its subtasks):

```markdown
## Task Development #[ID]
**Date**: [Current date] (use `date "+%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S"` in shell to get timestamp)
**Title**: [Task title]

### Summary
- Status: Completed
- Estimated time: [time]
- Time spent: [time]
- Approach used: [brief description]
- Subtasks completed: [list of subtask numbers if applicable]

### Implementation
- Modified files: [list]
- Tests added: [yes/no - details]
- Dependencies: [if applicable]
- Commits made: [brief description of each commit]

### Observations
- [Important points for future reference]
- [Technical decisions made]
- [Possible future improvements]
```

**MANDATORY**: Complete BOTH steps:

1. Store in Basic Memory MCP using `write_note` with folder "development-logs"
2. **ALSO** create the physical file using the `write` tool at `docs/memories/development-logs/task-[ID]-[title].md`
3. Use `read_note` from Basic Memory to get the content and copy it to the physical file

### 12. üíæ FINAL PUSH

- **Action**: Ask permission for final push of all subtask commits to feature branch
- Only push when all subtasks are complete and documented
- This push should include all subtask commits made during the task

### 13. ‚õÑ OPENING THE PULL REQUEST

- **Action**: Before create the PR, ask for my approval.
Use the Github MCP (or if not available Github CLI) to open a PR with a comprehensive and accurate description of the implementation.
- **Action**: Use Github MCP to request review from Copilot
**NEVER** Add any comment releated to the Agent doing the Pull request (for example, avoid any reference to opencode, claude code, gemini, etc)

### 14. üì¢ COMPLETION NOTIFICATION

- **Action**: Notify about task completion
- **Notification format**:

```markdown
‚úÖ Task #[ID] completed successfully

üìã [Task title]
üîß Implementation: [brief summary]
‚úîÔ∏è QA: Passed all checks
üíæ Commit: [commit hash]
üìù Log: Recorded in Basic Memory MCP
```

## üö´ NO NO Actions (Development Guidelines)

Based on your development guidelines, here are the **NO NO actions**:

---

## üî¥ Development Workflow Violations

- **NEVER** skip steps in the mandatory development workflow  
- **NEVER** commit when QA fails (`pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test` and `pnpm build` must all pass)  
- **NEVER** continue if QA check fails because 'errors were already there'. In cases like this, ask me if you can skip or fix them.
- **NEVER** work without marking task in-progress first  
- **NEVER** complete task without documentation (development memory logging)  
- **NEVER** commit failing QA ‚Äì Quality gates are mandatory  
- **NEVER** Assume unspecified requirements
- **NEVER** Overengineer solutions
- **NEVER** Include any agent information in the commit message (like Co-Authored-By:)
- **NEVER** reference task or subtask IDs in commit messages - focus purely on the work done
- **NEVER** create physical development logs for subtasks - only for complete tasks
- **NEVER** bypass git hooks with `--no-verify` or similar flags - git hooks are mandatory quality gates
- Under **NO** circumstance commit code when there are issues from QA scripts (even warnings)  

---

## üìÅ File Creation Violations

- **NEVER** create files unless absolutely necessary for achieving your goal  
- **NEVER** proactively create documentation files (`*.md`) or README files  
- **ALWAYS** prefer editing existing files to creating a new one  

---

## üß™ Testing Violations

- **NEVER** use `.spec.ts` extensions ‚Äì Use `.test.ts` only  
- **NEVER** use `specs` directories ‚Äì Use `tests` only  
- **NEVER** use `fireEvent` ‚Äì **ALWAYS** use [`@testing-library/user-event`](https://testing-library.com/docs/user-event/intro)  
- **NEVER** wrap `userEvent` calls in manual `act()` blocks  
- **NEVER** commit tests with warnings  

---

## üèó Architecture Violations

- **ALWAYS** get documentation information about libraries from Context7 MCP, before start to using them
- **ALWAYS** use Serena MCP for codebase exploration before making changes
- **NEVER** assume libraries are available ‚Äì Always check existing usage first  
- **NEVER** add comments unless explicitly asked  
- **NEVER** skip existing patterns ‚Äì Follow codebase conventions  
- **NEVER** commit secrets or keys to repository  
- **NEVER** modify code without first understanding the existing structure (use `serena_get_symbols_overview`)

---

## üìã TaskMaster Violations

- **NEVER** use `force` when creating new tasks (keep historical reasons)  
- **NEVER** work on tasks without proper status tracking  

---

## ‚úÖ The Golden Rule

> Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.

---

These are the absolute prohibitions that will break your development workflow, code quality, or project standards.

---

## üÜò IN CASE OF PROBLEMS

### QA Failing

1. **STOP** all implementation
2. Analyze reported errors
3. Resolve one by one
4. Run QA again
5. Only continue when 100% clean

### Doubts about Requirements

1. **DO NOT ASSUME** - always ask
2. Consult task details in Task Master
3. Request specific clarifications
4. Document clarifications for future reference

### Technical Problems

1. **Use Serena MCP** for codebase exploration and analysis
2. Consult previous development logs (use `serena_read_memory`)
3. Check task dependencies
4. Request specific technical guidance
5. Document solution for similar cases (use `serena_write_memory`)

**Key Serena MCP Use Cases:**

- **File Analysis**: Use `serena_get_symbols_overview` before modifying files
- **Code Search**: Use `serena_find_symbol` and `serena_search_for_pattern` to understand existing implementations
- **Safe Modifications**: Use symbol-based tools (`serena_replace_symbol_body`, `serena_insert_after_symbol`) instead of regex replacements when possible
- **Project Memory**: Use `serena_read_memory` to access project knowledge and `serena_write_memory` to document findings

---

## üìä QUALITY METRICS

The workflow is considered successful when:

- ‚úÖ 100% of QA checks pass
- ‚úÖ Task implemented as per specification
- ‚úÖ Status correctly updated in Task Master
- ‚úÖ Complete log recorded in Basic Memory MCP
- ‚úÖ Clean and well-documented commit
- ‚úÖ Zero rework needed

---

**Remember: This workflow ensures quality, traceability, and consistency. Following each step religiously is fundamental to project success.**
